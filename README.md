# Cube-Game
The objective of the Cube Game is to identify four vertices of a cube that share the same color. The cube's area is then calculated, and the player's score increases with the cube's size. For instance, in the screenshot provided, selecting four blue vertices would result in a score of 6 (calculated as 3x2). The game also records scores along with the player's name.
The game features three different difficulty levels, each with a varying number of colors. As the difficulty increases, the grid includes more colors. Each difficulty level has its own separate scoreboard.
In the project used Java and PostgreSql integration for database management and JavaFX for user interface.
